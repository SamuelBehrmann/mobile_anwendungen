# MediSupport

## Abstract
MediSupport is a helper app designed to share medical knowledge with a wide variety of people. 
Users are able to react, interact and obtain medical knowledge for their own benefit. 
Posts created by verified medical staff are the foundation for healthy and intriguing discussions. 

## Description
The Goal is to make medical information accessable for everybody. Nowadays the internet is full of fake news, 
intentionally and unintentionally shared wrong medical information. By creating a moderated and safe environment users can 
read up on day to day medical topics that they are interessted in. They can share their stories or issues and request help
by zertified medical staff. Because everyone is able to engage in the discussions, people get their questions answered and wrong information will be corrected. 

## Targeted Problem
The main problem we try to fix is the lack of medical knowledge among the common person. This leads to overworked and overbooked 
doctors. By solving this issue people who dearly need help can actually get appointments at doctors, since they are no longer held back from small and insignificant problems that people can fix themself. 

## Target groups
Our target group is primarely the German low and middle class. After that we believe that this Project could also be very hepful for elderly people and medical students.
